# Just Graduated
Just Graduated is a blog I built that seeks to offer financial knowledge and direction to those who may be at the start or will soon be receiving income but likely have minimal knowledge of what to do with it. The intended audience was recent college graduates, however, I realized that many people, no matter the age, usually have little to no knowledge about how to handle their finances. The blog also offers financial news around the country through an API so users are aware of the news going on in the country. 

# Purpose
The goal behind this project was to build a medium to serve and help people in my position, recent college graduates, who may know little to nothing about money. I've realized that many people lack financial knowledge, especially since there are only a few courses that teach anything about it. Even if the reader has not graduated yet or has been graduated for some years now, anyone who is looking to make better choices with their money can benefit from this.

# Technologies
For this project, I used the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to make the blog a full stack web application. I also used JWT (JSON Web Token) and Redux for user authentication. I implemeneted a REST API using the RAPID API so I could bring in financial news from different newspapers, and I also implemented a Quote of the Day API which displays famous quotes and refreshes everyday
